Experience the convenience of getting a custom dental crown in just one visit with our CEREC same-day crown technology.

## The CEREC Advantage

Traditional crowns require multiple visits and weeks of waiting. CEREC changes everything:

| Traditional Crowns | CEREC Same-Day |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 2-3 appointments | Single visit |
| 2-3 weeks waiting | Same day |
| Messy impressions | Digital scan |
| Temporary crown | No temporary needed |

## How It Works

### 1. Digital Scanning
We use a small camera to take precise 3D images of your tooth - no messy impression materials needed.

### 2. Computer Design
Using advanced software, we design your custom crown right before your eyes, ensuring perfect fit and aesthetics.

### 3. In-Office Milling
Our CEREC milling unit carves your crown from a solid block of tooth-colored ceramic in about 15 minutes.

### 4. Placement
We bond your new crown in place, make any final adjustments, and you leave with your permanent restoration.

## When CEREC Is Right for You

CEREC crowns are ideal for:

- **Damaged Teeth** - Cracked, chipped, or broken teeth
- **Large Cavities** - When a filling isn't enough
- **After Root Canal** - To protect and strengthen the tooth
- **Cosmetic Improvements** - Reshaping or improving tooth appearance
- **Busy Schedules** - When you can't make multiple appointments
