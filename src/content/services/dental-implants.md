Dental implants are the gold standard for replacing missing teeth. Dr. Deepak Bhagat, a Diplomate of the International Congress of Oral Implantologists (ICOI) since 2004, brings over two decades of expertise to every implant case.

## Why Choose Implants?

Unlike dentures or bridges, dental implants:

- **Integrate with Your Jawbone** - Titanium posts fuse with bone for permanent stability
- **Prevent Bone Loss** - Stimulate the jaw like natural tooth roots
- **Stand Alone** - No grinding down adjacent healthy teeth
- **Feel Natural** - Eat, speak, and smile with confidence

## The Implant Process

### Phase 1: Consultation & Planning
We use advanced 3D imaging to plan your treatment with precision, ensuring optimal placement and outcomes.

### Phase 2: Implant Placement
The titanium implant post is surgically placed into the jawbone. This typically heals over 3-4 months as the implant fuses with the bone.

### Phase 3: Abutment & Crown
Once healed, we attach the abutment and custom-crafted crown, completing your new tooth.

## Types of Implants We Offer

- **Single Tooth Implants** - Replace one missing tooth
- **Implant-Supported Bridges** - Replace multiple adjacent teeth
- **All-on-4** - Full arch restoration with just four implants
