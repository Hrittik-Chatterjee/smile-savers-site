## Tips for Parents

**Start Early**
Clean your baby's gums with a soft cloth even before teeth appear.

**Make It Fun**
Use fun toothbrushes, let kids pick their toothpaste flavor, and brush together as a family.

**Lead by Example**
Children who see parents prioritizing dental health are more likely to do the same.
