Root canal therapy saves teeth that would otherwise need to be extracted. Despite its reputation, modern root canal treatment is comfortable and highly effective.

## When Is a Root Canal Needed?

Inside each tooth is soft tissue called pulp, containing nerves and blood vessels. When the pulp becomes infected or inflamed due to:

- Deep decay
- Repeated dental procedures
- Cracks or chips
- Trauma to the tooth

A root canal removes the infected pulp, cleans the canal, and seals it to prevent further infection.

## Our Gentle Approach

We prioritize your comfort throughout the procedure:

1. **Thorough Numbing** - Advanced anesthesia ensures you feel nothing during treatment
2. **Modern Technology** - Rotary instruments and digital imaging for precision
3. **Efficient Treatment** - Most root canals completed in one visit
4. **Post-Care Support** - Clear instructions and follow-up care

## What to Expect

### Before Treatment
We'll take X-rays and examine your tooth to confirm the diagnosis and plan your treatment.

### During Treatment
After numbing the area, we access the pulp chamber, remove infected tissue, clean and shape the canals, then seal them with biocompatible material.

### After Treatment
A temporary filling protects the tooth until your permanent crown is placed, typically within two weeks.
