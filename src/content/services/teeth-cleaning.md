Professional teeth cleaning is essential for maintaining good oral health. Even with excellent home care, plaque and tartar can build up in hard-to-reach areas.

## Why Professional Cleanings Matter

Home brushing and flossing remove most plaque, but professional cleanings are necessary to:

- **Remove Tartar** - Hardened plaque that can't be removed at home
- **Reach Hidden Areas** - Clean between teeth and below the gumline
- **Polish Teeth** - Remove surface stains for a brighter smile
- **Apply Protective Treatments** - Fluoride to strengthen enamel
