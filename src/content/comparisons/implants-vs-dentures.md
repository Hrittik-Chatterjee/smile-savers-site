intro: |
  <p>When it comes to replacing missing teeth, dental implants and dentures are the two most common options. Both can restore your smile and improve your ability to eat and speak, but they differ significantly in terms of cost, longevity, comfort, and maintenance.</p>
  <p>This comprehensive guide will help you understand the key differences between dental implants and dentures, so you can make an informed decision about your dental care.</p>
verdict: |
  <p><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> For most patients with adequate bone density and good overall health, dental implants offer the best long-term value and quality of life. They're a one-time investment that can last a lifetime, preserve your jawbone, and function exactly like natural teeth.</p>
  <p>However, dentures remain an excellent choice for patients who prefer a non-surgical option, have budget constraints, or aren't candidates for implant surgery. Modern dentures are more comfortable and natural-looking than ever before.</p>
  <p>The best choice depends on your individual circumstances. We recommend scheduling a consultation to discuss your specific needs and goals.</p>
faqs:
  - question: Can I switch from dentures to implants later?
    answer: Yes, many patients successfully transition from dentures to implants. However, prolonged denture use can cause bone loss, which may require bone grafting before implant placement. Earlier transition typically means easier implant placement.
  - question: Are implant-supported dentures an option?
    answer: Yes! Implant-supported dentures (also called overdentures) combine the benefits of both options. A few implants anchor the denture in place, providing more stability than traditional dentures at a lower cost than full implant restoration.
  - question: Which option is better for eating?
    answer: Dental implants allow you to eat anything without restriction, just like natural teeth. Dentures may require avoiding sticky, hard, or chewy foods and can affect your sense of taste.
  - question: How do I care for each option?
    answer: Implants are cared for like natural teeth—brush, floss, and regular dental visits. Dentures require daily removal, cleaning with special solutions, and soaking overnight.
